# Declarative parallel programming and on-your-own hands-on

## Declarative parallel programming

- C++17 for_each [loop_c17.cpp](./loop_c17.cpp) ( serial version [loop_c17_serial.cpp](./loop_c17_serial.cpp) )
- Kokkos [loop_kokkos.cpp](./loop_kokkos.cpp) and [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt)

## Experiment on your own

Spend some time implementing parallel and/or accelerated versions
of the algorithms you normally work with.

Feel free to use either OpenMP or one of the above declarative parralel paradigms.
