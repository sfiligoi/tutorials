Tutorial hands-on
=================

The tutorial hands-ons in this tree have been developed
for execution in containerized environments
(ideally Kubernetes, as in the National Research Platform)
using NVIDIA GPUs.

Most examples should work in other environments,
but may need different compilaton steps.

The examples also assume at least 10 CPU cores,
8 GB of system memory and 8 GB of GPU memory.

Recommended container image
---------------------------

All tutorial hand-ons can be run inside the
nvcr.io/nvidia/nvhpc:24.7-devel-cuda_multi-ubuntu22.04
container.
